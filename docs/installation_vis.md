# CryoSiam-Vis Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install `cryosiam-vis`, a lightweight visualization tool for exploring and inspecting predictions generated by **CryoSiam**.

CryoSiam-Vis can be installed independently, but it is typically used alongside CryoSiam.

---

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- Conda

---

## Step 1: Create the Environment

CryoSiam-Vis uses a predefined Conda environment to ensure that all visualization dependencies are installed with compatible versions.

Create the environment by running:

```bash
conda env create -f https://github.com/frosinastojanovska/cryosiam_vis/blob/main/environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate cryosiam_vis
```

## Step 2: Install `cryosiam_vis`

With the environment activated, clone the CryoSiam-Vis repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frosinastojanovska/cryosiam_vis.git
cd cryosiam_vis
```

Install CryoSiam-Vis into the active environment:

```bash
pip install --no-deps .
```

> The `--no-deps` flag ensures that dependencies provided by Conda are used instead of reinstalling them with pip.

## Step 3. Verify the installation

To verify that CryoSiam-Vis was installed correctly, run:

```bash
cryosiam_vis --version
```

##  Don't Have Conda Installed?
